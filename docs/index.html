            Quantum Tetris
          </h1>

          <p>
            Our Quantum Tetris game investigates the concept of true randomness
            in games and celebrates noise—a beautiful imperfection of the
            current generation quantum computers. So, have you ever wondered
            what is random? In our world, classical computers can only generate
            pseudo-random numbers using seeds. The promise of a perfect,
            zero-noise quantum computer suggests a possibility of true
            randomness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided to use Tetris—a well-known game—to display our concept.
            In classic Tetris, the player could theoretically predict which
            block appears next, if they would know the seed of the random
            function. A quantum computer could create truly random numbers,
            preventing this scenario from every happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, quantum computers still produce a lot of false values.
            Qubits cannot hold their state for long, resulting in occasional
            wrong calculations. This phenomenon is called <i>noise</i>. The
            longer the circuit, the more probable it is that a calculation got
            disturbed, hence more noise is appearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, noise is an unwanted side-effect. However, we thought this
            could be an interesting way to display in our Tetris. All shapes are
            generated by a quantum computer. Noise creates shapes that are not
            intended, allowing for new blocks that do not fall in the regular
            'four pieces attached' ruleset, creating a whole new Tetris
            experience. These "noisy shapes" are highlighted in red in the game
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also displays a quantum circuit metaphorically. The longer you
            play, the noisier shapes appear.
