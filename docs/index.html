            <p>
              This project is a result of the
              <span class="footnoteLabel"
                >Quantum Design Jam from IBM and Parsons</span
              >
              in October 2021.
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
              Our Quantum Tetris game investigates the concept of true
              randomness in games and celebrates noise—a beautiful imperfection
              of the current generation quantum computers. So, have you ever
              wondered what is random? In our world, classical computers can
              only generate pseudo-random numbers using seeds. The promise of a
              perfect, zero-noise quantum computer suggests a possibility of
              true randomness.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to use Tetris—a well-known game—to display our concept.
              In classic Tetris, the player could theoretically predict which
              block appears next, if they would know the seed of the random
              function. A quantum computer could create truly random numbers,
              preventing this scenario from every happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, quantum computers still produce a lot of false values.
              Qubits cannot hold their state for long, resulting in occasional
              wrong calculations. This phenomenon is called <i>noise</i>. The
              longer the circuit, the more probable it is that a calculation got
              disturbed, hence more noise is appearing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, noise is an unwanted side-effect. However, we thought
              this could be an interesting way to display in our Tetris. All
              shapes are generated by a quantum computer. Noise creates shapes
              that are not intended, allowing for new blocks that do not fall in
              the regular 'four pieces attached' ruleset, creating a whole new
              Tetris experience. These "noisy shapes" are highlighted in red in
              the game above.
            </p>
            <p>
              To put this in perspective. The quantum circuit that generates the
              blocks used in the game here, is set up to only generate the seven
              regular shapes in Tetris. The "noisy shapes" are only a result of
              the miscalculations when running the circuit on a quantum
              computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also displays a quantum circuit metaphorically. The longer you
              play, the more noisy shapes appear.

                It can also happen that accidentally a real tetronimoe is
                generated through the noise. This happens due to the fact, that
                some tetronimoes fit in more than one combination of our grid,
                and we do not filter them out (yet).

            <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>
              To communicate the noise in quantum, we searched for a simple
              example of to display binary data—so <code>0</code>s and
              <code>1</code>s—the output of a qunatum calculation. As we wanted
              to focus on the topic noise in quantum operations, we needed to
              also find an exmaple that is not only easy to represent in this
              binary format, but also an example that highlights the unwanted
              results of the binary combinations. For example, a randomly
              generated image consiting out of black and white pixels would not
              display the noise, as the viewer of the image only sees a
              salt-and-pepper-like image with no clues what would not be wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also we needed to restrain from picking a topic in which noise
              represents an unwanted element but which does not affect the
              regular output. For example, generating an image of the sea and
              noise occasionally drops in trees would not represent the concept
              either as tress were not in the equation in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we wanted to make out project playful, so that the
              topic is easier to understand and also more fun, of course. This
              is why we looked at popular games, especially older ones that are
              easier to imitate. Our decision fairly quickly fell on the popular
              game Tetris.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started with translating the tetronimoes (the Tetris blocks)
              into a simple grid, that we could describe in a binary way. Tetris
              blocks always consist of
              <span class="footnoteLabel">four connected squares</span>. One
              thus can fit all possible "real" tetronimoe combinations in a
              <code>2×4</code> grid. This can be represented again in a simple
              bit array mapping to the single cells of the grid.<span
                class="note"
                >(Fig. 1)</span
              >
              This way we can map a buffer of eight digits to any existing block
              we want. E.g., <code>0010 1011</code> would then translate into
              the "L" tetromino.<span class="note">(Fig. 2)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on this system, we can generate all possible blocks only by
              using <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s. But in this particular
              example, a different combination of these digits would result in
              "unwanted" Tetris blocks. Here the noise affects the regular code
              in specific way so that it is a great representation of how noise
              alters our expected outcome. So could for example a
              noise-tetronimoe contain more or less than the regular four
              blocks, or
              <span class="footnoteLabel"
                >have them arranged in a different way</span
              >, generating other combinations, that usually do not exist in the
              game.<span class="note">(Fig. 3)</span>

            <h2>The Quantum Circuit</h2>
            <p>
              Based on our model simplifying the blocks to a simple binary code,
              we were able to generate the quantum circuit. Generally, by just
              positioning a qubit in a default superposition, we would receive
              <i>truly random</i> binary combinations. This, however, would
              result in just random pieces. This would defy our goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we needed to map all the relevant combinations for the
              seven tetrominoes that exist in the original game. Using the
              resulting seven binary strings, we could define the logical
              porbabilities after each digit to eventually get an equal
              distribution of all pieces.<span class="note">(Fig. 4)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing this, we were able to create a relatively straight forward
              quantum circuit generating exactly these seven blocks.<span
                class="note"
                >(Fig. 5)</span
              >
              Theoretically, in a perfect quantum system, <i>only</i> one of
              these seven blocks should result at the end of
              <span class="footnoteLabel">the circuit</span>. Running this
              circuit multiple times would then generate a truly random set of
              pieces. But—what is the whole purpose of this project—quantum
              circuits <i>are not</i> perfect (yet). Due to the very instable
              state of a qubit, it could happen that a qubit changes
              spontaneously its orientation, thus affecting the future
              measurements of its position—the noise wihtin the circuit. Due to
              this noise, the circuit outputs bit arrays that should
              theoretically not be possible in its layout, our red quantum
              tetronimoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longer a circuit gets, hence the more often a qubit is
              measured, the more noise is likely to interfere with the result of
              the calculation. In our case the calculation for one block is
              fairly long thus increasing the probability of irregular blocks.

                    This is the visualization that we used to map the
                    probabilites to our circuit. A branch to the left means if
                    it hits <code>1</code> and a branch to the right results in
                    <code>0</code>. Each column represent a digit of our buffer.
                    The red numbers indicate the probability that is needed, or
                    in our case the superposition the cubit needs to be put in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the end of each branch you can see the final buffer and
                    its corresponding tetronimoe.

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>
              With Quantum Tetris, we want to display in a very playful way how
              noise, that is an unwanted element in quantum computing, could be
              used as a wanted design element. Similar to how we like the
              imperfections in other analog media like photography.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another interesting factor in quantum computing that we want to
              highlight here is the potential of complete randomness. Qubits
              allow for a <i>real</i> randomn generation of values, in contrast
              to the other methods that currently exist in algorithms. For now,
              randomness is based on some sort of seed value which determines
              the outcome of every randomly generated number.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a quantum computer is not meant to execute its calculations in
              real time—like personal computers—but rather to get a task,
              calculate it, and then return the results, we precalculated a
              batch of blocks that are selected in our game. The blocks
              themselves are still completely generated on a real quantum
              computer from IBM.
            </p>
            <p>
              To also amplify the trait of quantum computing that the longer a
              circuit is, the more noise will likely appear, we included a
              simply (not <i>truly</i> quantum) mechanism that will spawn more
              irregular tetronimoes the longer a game is going.

            <h2>Quantum Tetris Arcade</h2>

            <p>
              To make the experience as fun as possible, we created a physical,
              simplified Quantum Tetris Arcade Display.<span class="note"
                >(Fig. 6)</span
              >
              With a NES-like controller, it displays the same simple control
              layout as the cult GameBoy version. When not actively playing, the
              game continues to drop blocks at a random position so that it can
              simultaneously function as an art piece.
