## What is Quantum about this?

The blocks are generated using a quantum computer. This enables multiple possiblities for the Tetris game:

1. The blocks appear in a truly random order
2. Noise in the quantum circuit also generates pieces that should not exist

Read more about the Tetris block generation [here](tetris-block-generator/README.md).


## Versions

Throughout this process, we created multiple versions of this game:

- Find the Processing/Java version [here](Tetris)
- Find the p5/JavaScript version [here](docs/js/quantumTetris.js)
- Find the python version [here](hardware/quantumTetris.py)

The code is adapted from [Techview's Tetris](https://github.com/techiew/Tetris).
