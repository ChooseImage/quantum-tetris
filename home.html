            <p>
              What would happen if you combine Tetris with a Quantum computer?
              The winning entry of the

              in October 2021 explores just that!
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
              Quantum Tetris game investigates the concept of true randomness in
              games and celebrates noise—a beautiful imperfection of the current
              generation of quantum computers. Have you ever wondered what is
              random? In today's world, classical computers can merely generate
              pseudo-random numbers using seeds. The promise of a perfect,
              zero-noise quantum computer hints at the possibility of true
              randomness.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to use Tetris—a well-known game—to explore the
              visualise of true random generated by a quantum computer. In
              classic Tetris, a player can theoretically predict which block
              appears next, if they knew the seed of the random function. A
              quantum computer can create truly random numbers, thus ensuring
              true randomness which cannot be predicted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, quantum computers, still in their nascency, produce a
              lot of false values as they perform calculations. Qubits cannot
              hold their state for long, resulting in occasional erroneous
              calculations. This phenomenon is called <i>noise</i>. The longer
              the circuit, the more probable it is that a calculation is
              disturbed, hence more noise appears.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, noise is an unwanted side effect. However, we could see
              the potential of using this noise to great effect to supercharge a
              game of Tetris! We programmed a quantum computer to generate the
              regular seven kinds of Tetris blocks. The noise produced by the
              quantum computer created blocks that were not intended, allowing
              for new blocks that do not fall in the regular 'four pieces
              attached' Tetris ruleset, creating a whole new Tetris experience.
              These strange, and irregular "noisy shapes" are a result of the
              miscalculations which occur when running the calculations on a
              quantum computer. If you play the the game above, you'll see those
              new blocks, which are highlighted in red.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only is Quantum Tetris a fun game, but it's also a great
              metaphor for a quantum circuit. The longer you play, the more
              noisy shapes appear, just like the longer you run a calculation on
              a quantum computer, the more noise you'll encounter.

            <h2>Quantum Tetris Arcade</h2>

            <p>
              To make the experience even more fun and immersive, we created a
              physical version of the game—the Quantum Tetris Arcade
              Edition!<span class="note">(Fig. 6)</span>
              With a NES-like controller, it feels just like playing the cult
              classic GameBoy Tetris! When not being actively played, the game
              continues to drop blocks and functions as a passive art piece.
