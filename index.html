            The basic mathematical framework for quantum mechanics — the
            behaviour of tiny particles of matter — was originally developed in
            the early part of the 20th century by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg,
            Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac, amongst others. Now, 100 years
            later, the

            investigates how organisations are beginning to explore a
            fundamentally different type of computer, capable of exploiting
            these remarkable physical properties to tackle problems that would
            otherwise remain intractable.

            It is time for business leaders to begin planning for this new era
            of quantum computing. Although a commercially viable, fault-tolerant
            and fully error-corrected quantum computer is yet to be built, the
            power of quantum computers is increasing rapidly. In addition,
            public and private investment is growing quickly. New technology
            start-ups are being created every year and higher-education
            institutions have begun to answer the call for more quantum talent.
            Already, organisations have access, via the cloud, to quantum
            computers that allow them to start to develop solutions for
            challenges that will never be fully solved using classical computers
            — in areas, such as optimisation, search and materials discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we wait for error-corrected quantum computers to be developed, we
            can still take advantage of contemporary quantum computers which
            happen to produce "noise", a phenomena which arises from quantum
            fluctuations

          <h2>Quantum Tetris</h2>

          <p>
            Quantum Tetris is an interactive project combining the classic
            Tetris game with quantum computing. It investigates the impact of
            true randomness in games, celebrates noise, a wonderous imperfection
            of contemporary quantum computers, and makes the knowledge of
            quantum computing approachable through an accessible medium.

            What is random"? Currently, ""random"" and spontaneous spawning
            actions in all video games are prompted by seeds in classical
            computers. It generates only pseudo-randomness through a coded
            function, according to which the players can theoretically predict
            the games. However, with its ultra-high speed, a zero-noise quantum
            computer will land itself bot-proof and cracking-proof. Another
            fascinating aspect of quantum computing is quantum noise, resulting
            from our current quantum computers' inherent uncertainty and
            unpredictability. In our project, we use Tetris as an agent to
            visualize the true randomness generated in a game while
            simultaneously incorporating quantum noise to trigger mutated
            irregular blocks. Quantum Tetris challenges the audience to adapt to
            a constantly changing state, facilitating a unique and unpredictable
            experience with a physical manifestation. As one of the first
            quantum games in the world, this project integrates generative
            digital art and interactive narrative to showcase quantum computers'
            immense potential and the complexity and beauty of quantum
            mechanics.

            Quantum Tetris uses a real quantum computer to generate the white
            tetrominos (Tetris blocks) for the game. If you see a yellow block,
            that's quantum noise! A contemporary quantum computer produces noise
            while performing calculations, more so if the calculation runs for
            longer periods of time. So if you're good at the game, you'll
            encounter more noise (yellow blocks)!

          <h2>Concept</h2>

          <p>
            To communicate the noise in quantum, we searched for a simple way to
            display binary data—so <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s—the
            output of a quantum calculation. As we wanted to focus on the topic
            noise in quantum operations, we needed to also find an example which
            is not only easy to represent in this binary format, but also an
            example that showcases the unwanted results of the binary
            combinations. We wanted to create something which allows for the
            'noise' generated to add to the experience. For example, if we
            tasked a quantum computer to generate random images consisting of
            black and white pixels (where <code>0</code> is white and
            <code>1</code> is black) , we would not be able to see the noise, as
            we wouldn't be able to distinguish between 'true' random outputs,
            and 'noise' affected random outputs. The results for both would
            visually appear to be identical—both would look like scrambled black
            and white images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we needed to highlight the 'noise', we didn't want the
            results to be too distracting either. The noise needed to
            represented by an unwanted element but not to a detrimental degree
            which would adversely affect the experience. For example, if we
            assigned the quantum computer to generate an image of the ocean and
            the 'noise' manifested in the form of unrelated objects appearing in
            the image, like a tree, that wouldn't be an accurate representation
            of the concept as trees were not a part of the equation in the first
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also wanted to make something which would include elements of
            play so that the concept is easier to understand and also more fun!
            This led us to look at popular games, especially older ones that are
            easier to replicate. We quickly narrowed in on Tetris, as it's
            popular, and easy to play—an ageless classic.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started with translating the tetrominos (the Tetris blocks) into
            a simple grid, that we could describe with binary digits. Tetris
            blocks always consist of
            <span class="footnoteLabel">four connected squares</span>. One can
            thus can fit all possible "real" tetromino combinations in a
            <code>2×4</code> grid. This can be represented again in a simple bit
            array mapping to the single cells of the grid.<span class="note"
              >(Fig. 1)</span
            >
            This way we can map a buffer of eight digits to any existing block
            we want. E.g., <code>0010 1011</code> would then translate into the
            "L" tetromino.<span class="note">(Fig. 2)</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this system, we can generate all possible blocks by only
            using <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s. But in this particular
            example, a different combination of these digits would result in
            unintentional and strange Tetris blocks. Here the noise affects the
            regular code in a very specific way, which makes it a great
            representation of how noise alters the usual and anticipated
            outcome. So, an example of a noise-tetromino would consist of more
            or less than the regular four blocks, or
            <span class="footnoteLabel"
              >have them arranged in a different way</span
            >, generating other combinations, that usually do not exist in the
            game.<span class="note">(Fig. 3)</span>

          <h2>The Quantum Circuit</h2>
          <p>
            Based on our model which translates the blocks to a simple binary
            code, we were able to generate the quantum circuit. Generally, by
            just positioning a qubit in a default superposition, we would
            receive
            <i>truly random</i> binary combinations. This however, would result
            in just random pieces. This would defy our goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we needed to map all the relevant combinations for the seven
            tetrominos that exist in the original game. Using the resulting
            seven binary strings, we can define the logical probabilities after
            each digit to eventually get an equal distribution of all
            pieces.<span class="note">(Fig. 4)</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing this, we were able to create a relatively straightforward
            quantum circuit which would only generate these exact seven
            blocks.<span class="note">(Fig. 5)</span> Theoretically, in a
            perfect quantum system, <i>only</i> one of these seven blocks should
            result at the end of <span class="footnoteLabel">the circuit</span>.
            Running this circuit multiple times would then generate a truly
            random set of pieces. But (which happens to be the purpose of this
            project) quantum circuits <i>are not</i> perfect (yet). Due to the
            very unstable state of a qubit, it's possible that a qubit changes
            its orientation spontaneously, thus affecting the subsequent
            measurements of its position—which results in the noise within the
            circuit. Due to this noise, the circuit produces bit arrays that
            should theoretically not be possible in its layout, which happen to
            be our yellow quantum, noisy tetrominos.
          </p>
          <p>
            The longer a circuit is, the more often a qubit is measured, which
            makes it more likely that noise is likely to interfere with the
            result of the calculation. In our case the calculation for one block
            is fairly long, which increasing the probability of irregular
            blocks.

                  This is the visualization that we used to map the
                  probabilities to our circuit. A branch to the left means if it
                  hits <code>1</code> and a branch to the right results in
                  <code>0</code>. Each column represent a digit of our buffer.
                  The red numbers indicate the probability that is needed, or in
                  our case, the superposition the cubit needs to be put in.

                  At the end of each branch you can see the final buffer and its

          <h2>The Game</h2>
          <p>
            With Quantum Tetris, we want to showcase the beauty of noise
            generated by quantum computing in a playful manner. Much in the same
            way, we like imperfections in other media, like analogue
            photography, or vinyl records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting factor in quantum computing that we want to
            highlight here is the potential of actual, pure randomness. Qubits
            allow for a <i>real</i> random generation of values, in contrast to
            the other methods that currently exist, which are based on some sort
            of seed value which determines the outcome of every randomly
            generated number.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a quantum computer is not meant to execute its calculations in
            real time (like personal computers) but rather, to get a task,
            calculate it, and then return the results, we pre-calculated a batch
            of blocks that are selected in our game. Even though it's not real
            time generation, the blocks themselves were still actually generated
            on a real quantum computer from IBM.
          </p>
          <p>
            To amplify the trait of quantum computing that the longer a circuit
            is, the more noise will likely appear, we included a simple (not
            <i>truly</i> quantum) mechanism which will spawn more irregular
            tetrominos the longer a game is played. The longer you a game of
            Quantum Tetris goes on for, the more noisy blocks you'll encounter.
            Play the game above and see for yourself!
